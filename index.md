Welcome to my blog! My name is George Lepska. I graduated from Wesleyan University in May of 2025. During my time at Wesleyan, I majored in Economics and minored in data analysis and art history. At Wesleyan, I grew a strong analytical background and developed a passion for data analysis. I am excited to bring my skills to the field as a business analyst.
